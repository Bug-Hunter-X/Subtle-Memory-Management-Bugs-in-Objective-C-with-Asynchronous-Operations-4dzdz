The solution involves careful management of object lifecycles and using techniques like weak references where appropriate.  Here's a corrected version:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObject *myObject; // Use weak reference

// ... in your asynchronous operation ...

dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ // Update UI on main thread
  if (self.myObject) {  // Check for nil before accessing
    // Update UI with self.myObject
  }
});
```

By using a `weak` reference, the property doesn't retain the object, thus avoiding the dangling pointer. The check for `nil` is crucial to prevent crashes when the object is already deallocated.  For `copy` properties and mutable objects, consider using immutable objects or creating a deep copy to ensure data consistency.
