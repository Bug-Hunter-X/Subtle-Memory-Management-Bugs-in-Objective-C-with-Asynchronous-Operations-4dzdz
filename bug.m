In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `nonatomic, strong`.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObject *myObject;
```

If `myObject` is assigned a value, and later that value is deallocated (e.g., through a different part of the application), the strong reference in the property will retain a dangling pointer.  This usually leads to crashes when the application attempts to access the now-invalid memory address.

The problem is exacerbated when dealing with asynchronous operations.  A common situation is when fetching data in the background. By the time the data arrives and the `myObject` is updated, the original object might've already been deallocated, resulting in a crash when the UI updates.

Another issue stems from improper usage of `copy` properties with mutable objects. If a mutable object is assigned to a property declared as `copy`, only a copy of the object's state is created at that point in time, not a persistent copy.  Subsequent mutations to the original object may not be reflected in the copied property, leading to inconsistent data.

This becomes a tricky bug to find because the crash often occurs later, not at the point where the original assignment is made.  Debugging requires carefully inspecting the object's lifecycle and memory management.
