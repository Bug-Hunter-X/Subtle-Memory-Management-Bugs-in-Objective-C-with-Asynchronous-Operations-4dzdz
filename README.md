# Subtle Memory Management Bugs in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to memory management, specifically with `nonatomic, strong` properties and asynchronous operations.  The bug arises from a dangling pointer and is difficult to debug due to the delayed crash.

The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.m` offers a solution by ensuring proper object lifecycle management and handling asynchronous operations correctly.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations and improper handling of object deallocation can lead to crashes due to dangling pointers. The `nonatomic, strong` property retains a reference even after the object is deallocated elsewhere in the application.
